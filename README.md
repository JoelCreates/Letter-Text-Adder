# Letter-Text-Adder
This repository contains a simple Python script, letter text adder, designed to automate the process of adding names and titles to a letter at specific locations.

# How It Works
1. Open the letter image in Photoshop.
2. Locate the desired position where you want to add the text in the letter using Photoshop's editing tools.
3. Note down the coordinates (X, Y) of the desired position.
4. Edit the script and locate the relevant code section where the text should be added.
5. Replace the existing coordinates with the coordinates you obtained from Photoshop, ensuring they are in the correct format. Also ensure that a 96d.p.i image is being used.
6. Run the script with Python, and it will automatically add the specified name and title to the letter at the designated position.
7. The modified letter will be saved as a new image file.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Photoshop
- A 96dpi image of the letter
